# TableViews-With-Enums

This example project shows an easy and dynamic way to fill a tableview with enums



* When an enum becomes helpful to fill a table view?

  1.- When you have a menu (settings, sidebar as examples), you can easily use enums to populate the tableview.  If at some point, a new row needs to be added, one can just add a new case in the enum. 
  
  2.- You have a view that can be separated in rows (custom cells) like a profile view or login view

* Advantages

  1.- Easy implementation
  
  2.- Easy maintenance
  
  3.- Everything is clearly encapsulated
  
  
* Disadvantage 

  1.- When interacting with custom cells, it becomes a little bit complicated (blocks needs to be added to comunicate whatever to the main view)
